# GAN-Satellite-to-Map
This project implements a Pix2Pix GAN using PyTorch to generate maps from satellite images. The code is adapted from junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix. This README outlines the steps to preprocess the dataset, train the Pix2Pix model, and test the model's performance on new images.
